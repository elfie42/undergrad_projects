#### This folder contains programs I created to help me study for EESC (Earth and Environmental Science) 211: Rocks, Minerals, and Soils in Fall 2023.

#### In this class we took weekly mineral quizzes. For the quizzes, we were given fifteen hand samples of rocks and minerals and were expected to identify them in 90 seconds based on properties such as color and luster, hardness, crystal family, and other such properties and also report their formulae. Each week, we were given a new list of 6-12 new minerals. That week's quiz would contain all of the samples from that week's list plus however many samples from previous sets to get to fifteen.

#### I created on my own the database of minerals and their properties as well as the two programs in this file to help me study for these mineral quizzes.
